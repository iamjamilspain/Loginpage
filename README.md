# Loginpage
I am buiding a program in C++ that gives the user an option to either signup or login. If the user chooses to signup, the system saves his/her details in a file that will
be accessed when the user is logging in. 
After the user has logged in, the system is going to allow the user to covert his/her chosen currency to a US dollar value
