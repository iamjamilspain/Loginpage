# Loginpage

I am buiding a program in C++ that gives the user an option to either **signup** or **login**. If the user chooses to signup, the system saves his/her details in a file that will be ~~accesse~~ when the user is logging in. 

### Exiting the System 

After the user has logged in, the system is going to allow the user to covert his/her chosen currency to a US dollar value.
* have your username
* have your password
* click the logout button 

1) this is number 1
2) this is number 2

### Further Comments

We will then test this out on a new server
------

inside github to see if it will display
